goals: 
use as little global code as possible.
separate state logic from the UI controls.
build the game so that it can be played, in full, in the console



gameboard prop inside of gameBoard object.
function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage. 
object to control the flow of the game itself.
gameBoard, and displayController - use a module
players objs - use factory functions

questions and concerns: 
    using a module instead of a factory function.



use 1 for x and 0 for o for each cell.
