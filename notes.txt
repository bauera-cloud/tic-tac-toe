goals: 
use as little global code as possible.
separate state logic from the UI controls.
build the game so that it can be played, in full, in the console

overall plan: finish console game. create the webpage for the DOM game. Add UI controls.

plan for today: (reread Git body suggestion. commit each step.)

create the tic-tac-toe board with css and html
get the winner for 3 in a row working correctly
make sure a tie is working
location is occupied function working


extra credit: console game: add computer ai.

implemented:
console game should not allow for player(s) to make a move on an occupied location $



make the game start against the easy computer. easy = random. medium = ai.
DOM - click CPU to change to P2

Dom elements and queries should not be responsible for storing or handling the implementation details of how our application works.
The DOM should be responsible for reading and displaying the application state to the user and providing an easy-to-use gateway to interact with the methods it needs to.
