goals: 
use as little global code as possible.
separate state logic from the UI controls.
build the game so that it can be played, in full, in the console

overall plan: finish console game. create the webpage for the DOM game. Add UI controls.

plan for today: reread Git body suggestion. commit each step. 
put every variable in their own factory function
console game should have an invalid input error message $
console game should allow to play against a player2
console game should not allow for player(s) to make a move on an occupied location $
console game should check for 3 in a row 
console game should congratulate the winning player
console game should check for a tie
console game should announce a tie
console game should have way to restart the game
extra credit: console game: add computer ai.



start the game by selecting a position for P1's token
P1 will always be X. P2 and CPU will always be O
make the game start against the easy computer. easy = random. medium = ai.
players and computer stored inside factory function
DOM - click CPU to change to P2
may use inheritance from factory functions.

Dom elements and queries should not be responsible for storing or handling the implementation details of how our application works.
The DOM should be responsible for reading and displaying the application state to the user and providing an easy-to-use gateway to interact with the methods it needs to.
